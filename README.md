## Python Basics

Python is an interpreted programming language. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm for organizing code for increased reusability and modularity.

## Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. An object is an instance of a class.

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. Types of inheritance include single-level, multilevel, hierarchical, multiple, and hybrid inheritance.

## Method Overriding

Method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the same name as a method in the parent class.

## Super() Function

The `super()` function is used within a child class to call methods from the parent class.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves hiding the internal details of an object and restricting direct access to its components.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the objects they operate on. Method overloading and method overriding are examples of polymorphism.

## Decorators

Decorators modify or extend the behavior of functions without changing their code. They are denoted by the `@decorator_name` syntax.

## Functional Programming Concepts

Lambda functions are anonymous functions used for small, single-expression tasks. The `map()` function applies a function to each element of an iterable. The `filter()` function filters elements from an iterable based on a specified condition.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks allows for graceful error handling in Python.

## Modules and Packages

Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python files. Packages are collections of related modules.

## Comprehensions

Comprehensions provide a concise way to create sequences like lists, dictionaries, and sets.

## Built-in Functions

Various built-in functions like `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `sorted()`, `type()`, etc., perform common tasks in Python.

## Control Statements

Control statements like `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, etc., control the flow of program execution.

## Type Casting

Type casting converts one data type to another, e.g., converting an integer to a string.

## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort organize elements in a specified order.
